# Unreleased

- Replace 3rd party `holochain_runtime` with `holochain-conductor-runtime`, modify FFI-bindings wrapper crate to use it. The runtime now makes calls via the `ConductorHandle` directly, without going through an `AdminWebsocket` to prevent unauthenticated access.
- Rename the FFI-bindings wrapper crate to `holochain-conductor-runtime-ffi` and generated kotlin bindings have been renamed accordingly.
- Removed the call `get_admin_port`, as an `AdminWebsocket` is no longer exposed.
- Split out types from holochain-conductor-runtime-ffi into separate crate holochain-conductor-runtime-types-ffi
- Create standalone kotlin library containing the types and client for binding and calling the HolochainService: `org.holochain.androidserviceruntime.holochain_service_client`
- Gradle setup for publishing standalone kotlin library to Maven Central
- Use published release in both tauri-plugin-holochain-service and tauri-plugin-holochain-service-consumer
- Minor fixes for android-service-runtime to get it working again
- Add function `isReady` to check that the conductor is available, expose in client and tauri-plugin-holochain-service
